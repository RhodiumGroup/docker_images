# Welcome!

If you're seeing this, you're on a jupyterhub server maintained by
[Rhodium Group](https://github.com/RhodiumGroup). Welcome!

If you have any questions, are troubleshooting an issue, or would like to report
a bug, don't hesitate to shout on the
[#rhg-hub](https://rhgroup.slack.com/archives/CA8DZHUH1) slack channel, or
file an issue on our
[github repository](https://github.com/RhodiumGroup/docker_images/issues).

If you are having trouble accessing either of these, please contact
[Michael Delgado](mailto:mdelgado@rhg.com).

Please note that the `~/about` folder in which this readme file lives is
overwritten on every server reboot. Do not attempt to save anything in this
folder - instead save your work in other folders within your home directory
(`/home/jovyan`, a.k.a. `~/`).
